To make prompt design easier and more effective, I wrote a small script that uses two LLMs in a collaborative-competitive loopâ€”one generates the prompt, and the other critiques it. Think of it as a mini-GAN but for prompts. 

ðŸ’¡ How it works:

One LLM generates a prompt based on your query.

The second LLM reviews and critiques it.

They go back and forth (up to max_iterations, which you can setâ€”default is 4) until they agree on a strong final version.

You can try queries like:
"Create a prompt for a SQL agent that reports to a supervisor agent, incorporating OpenAI best practices from the OpenAI prompting guide."

You'll see how the prompt evolves through feedbackâ€”fascinating to watch in real time.

Built on the Autogen framework (make sure itâ€™s installed).

Also you need to create your .env file including your API connections and credentials
